This is the complete version of the site. For it to be functioning, the user should :
- clone this repository and open two terminals : one in the client directory and the other in the server's. He should make sure that he creates a schema with the name that's cited on the "./server/server.js" and set the corresponding configuration in the same file. 
- He should then initiate respectively on the client's terminal and the server's the queries : npm install --force and npm install. 
- Finally, he should npm run start the two terminals : the tab of the site will automatically open on a navigator.
